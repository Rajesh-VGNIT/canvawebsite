                          <p class="mt-4">Every single life incident, no matter how seemingly
                            insignificant or small they are, holds the power to
                            shape and influence our lives. Today I stand before
                            you as a life coach and spiritual healer dedicated to
                            helping others find their own strengths and potential. 
                           But when I look back on my life, I can clearly see how
                            my life was full of misery, how my childhood
                            experiences shattered my self-worth, filled me with
                            shame, guilt, and fear, and completely broke my self
                           image. Which lead to self-doubt, making me question
                            my worthiness of love, success, and happiness. This
                            belief deeply affected various aspects of my life.</p>
                     </div>
                        
                    </div>
                 </div>
                 <p class="mt-4"> Throughout my life, I faced struggles with my relationships, career, and health.  I worked hard to get a job.
                    But when found one, I wasn’t happy at all. I changed my job thrice seeking happiness and satisfaction. Then I
                    realized that happiness doesn’t reside in external things, it blossoms from within. I was also struggling in my
                    relationships as I wasn’t able to communicate my thoughts, feelings, and needs properly or clearly to
                    anyone. </p>
                 <p>But one realization changed the trajectory of my life. My broken self-image and unresolved frustrations
                    were not only affecting me but also impacting those closest to me, including my own daughters.</p>
                <div class="row my_story_content1">
                    <div class="col-sm-7 col-lg-7">
                        <p>I saw how my own struggles and insecurities were
                            unintentionally shaping my daughter’s perception of herself
                            and the world around her.</p>
                        <p>Then, I embarked on a journey to not only heal myself but also
                          to create a nurturing environment for her.</p>
                        <p> I immersed myself in various methods, exploring different
                             healing modalities. It was a process of deep introspection,
                             reflection, and learning as I sought to understand my own
                             wounds and find the tools to heal them. It was through the
                             ancient wisdom of chakras and the support of my mentor I
                             started learning the key life skills for living a fulfilled life. The
                             symbolism of the tarot became the gateway of my
                             subconscious providing me insights and guidance when I
                             needed them the most. The tarot becomes a mirror reflecting
                             my inner struggles and untapped potential. In this voyage of
                             self-discovery, I not only found a deeper understanding of
                             myself but also witness the world around me through a new
                             lens of wisdom and wonder.</p>

                        <p>This wisdom healed my wounds and open the doors of a completely new life. The connection I lost with
                            myself built up again. I discover the untapped potential within me.  I outgrew my past and started
                            appreciating myself and the beauty within. I started to connect with my higher self. <br>
                           Now, my story has brought me to a pivotal moment – a moment of readiness to extend my hand to those
                            seeking guidance and support. With a heart overflowing with compassion and a profound understanding of
                            the human spirit, I am now stepping into the role of a healer and guide to others.<br>
                            As I embrace this new chapter, my mission is clear: to support and uplift those in need, just as I once yearned
                            for guidance and transformation. Together, we will navigate life’s complexities, uncover hidden strengths
                            and create a fulfilling future filled with self-love, resilience, and purpose.<br>
                            Throughout this transformative journey, I stand with firm dedication and a deep commitment to helping
                            others unlock the doors to their own healing and self-discovery. Each step I take in my life’s unfolding story
                            fills me with gratitude, knowing I have the opportunity to be a guiding light for others, illuminating their paths
                            to growth, healing, and endless possibilities. </p>
